# AI-Powered Streamlit Application

This project implements a sophisticated Streamlit-based web application that leverages the power of Openrouter's AI models to provide intelligent, context-aware responses. Built with Python as the core language, the application utilizes Pydantic AI for robust data validation and schema management, ensuring type safety and data integrity throughout the system. The Streamlit framework provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface where users can input a comprehensive prompt structure consisting of a system prompt (defining the AI's role and behavior), contextual information (providing relevant background or reference material), and specific questions or queries. The application seamlessly integrates with Openrouter's API to process these prompts and returns streaming responses in real-time, enabling users to see the AI's thought process and receive immediate feedback. Additionally, the integration with Langfuse provides comprehensive observability and monitoring capabilities, allowing developers to track performance metrics, analyze user interactions, and optimize the AI response quality. This architecture creates a robust, scalable solution that combines modern web development practices with cutting-edge AI capabilities, making it ideal for building intelligent conversational interfaces, content generation tools, or AI-powered decision support systems.
